Plugin In Development.

== Description ==

Plugin In Development. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

DO NOT DOWNLOAD

You have now been told

This is a very basic plugin (but not quite as basic as the previous one)

It aims to provide a way to vote "for', "against" or "Abstain" on a particular subject / statement.

It revolves around a table in the database that has 6 Fields: Id, Title, For, Against, Abstain, Is_Active

The basic functionality is that you press a link in the post/page, and then it registers your vote in the table, and re-graphs the results using the google charts API, as well as setting a cookie so you can't vote again.

On the backend is a table like the posts table, that shows all the content of the table. You can edit only the fields "title" and "is_active" but not the votes count. you can also view the results from the backend, and delete the votes

Any help would be appreciated. please may you reply here if you would like to. my main problem is lack of php knowledge, time, and experience of the wordpress APi in general, but i hope to learn from this whilst developing this plugin.

It seems that in my gusto with SVN i managed to delete the very small amount of work i had already done. No Worries, it's easier to start from scratch.
